/**
 
 ### Summary
 
 `NSRailsManagedObject` is the class in NSRails for using CoreData - any classes that inherit from it will be treated with a "remote correspondance" and ActiveResource-like APIs will be available, as well as any methods from its parent class NSManagedObject.
 This class contains the same methods as its NSRailsModel counterpart. The difference is that inheriting from this class will automatically insert the fetched objects into Core Data using a find-or-create methodology. You must ensure to name the class and its primary key according to the "Model"/"model_id" convention.
 You must set the managed object context by using the class method setManagedObjectContext: so that NSRails can automatically CRUD Core Data objects when using its ActiveResource-like methods.
 When the managed object context should be saved, this class will broadcast a notification defined in the NSRailsSaveCoreDataNotification constant. If you are using thread-specific contexts, you should respond to this notification and save the context according to your Core Data thread architecture. It is otherwise safe to disregard this notification.
 When defining the data model in the *.xcdatamodeld file, you must ensure to set the Class of any entities which inherit from NSRailsManagedObject to the same value as the entity name. Otherwise, Core Data will assume your entity inherits from NSManagedObject rather than from NSRailsManagedObject. If this is not done, your application *will* crash when NSRails attempts to insert new objects.
 
 About this document:
 
 - You'll notice that almost all `NSRailsModel` properties and methods are prefixed with `remote`, so you can quickly navigate through them with autocomplete.
 - When this document refers to an object's "model name", that means (by default) the name of its class. If you wish to define a custom model name (if the name of your model in Rails is distinct from your class name), use the `NSRailsUseModelName()` macro.
 - Before exploring this document, make sure that your class inherits from `NSRailsModel`, or of course these methods & properties will not be available.
 
 ### Available Macros
 
 - `NSRailsSync()` - define specific properties to be shared with Rails, along with configurable behaviors.
 - `NSRailsUseModelName()` - define a custom model name for your class, optionally with a custom plural. Takes string literal(s).
 - `NSRailsUseConfig()` - define a custom app URL for your class, optionally with username/password. Takes string literal(s).
 
 These macros can be defined right inside your subclass's implementation:
 
	@implementation Article  NSRailsUseModelName(@"post")
	@synthesize title, content;
	NSRailsSync(title, content)
	
	@end
 
 Please see their detailed descriptions on [the NSRails wiki](https://github.com/dingbat/nsrails/wiki/Macros).
 
 ### Validation Errors
 
 If a create or update failed due to validation reasons, NSRails will package the validation failures into a dictionary. This can be retrieved using the key constant `NSRValidationErrorsKey` in the `userInfo` property of the error. This dictionary contains **each failed property as a key**, with each respective object being **an array of the reasons that property failed validation**. For instance,
 
	 NSError *error;
	 [user createRemote:&error];
	 if (error)
	 {
		 NSDictionary *validationErrors = [[error userInfo] objectForKey:NSRValidationErrorsKey];
		 
		 for (NSString *property in validationErrors)
		 {
			 for (NSString *reasonForFailure in [validationErrors objectForKey:property])
			 {
				 NSLog(@"%@ %@",property,reasonForFailure);
			 }
		 }
	 }
